 - Maybe we want to generate for both linux and windows "at the same time"

 Later go over the code and handle all the errors and exception in a better way

 Program:
    Windows - Done

 Lua:
    Need better error handling in there

 Linux: Takes the project and generates a batch script and make code
    Generate specific make code: Use the make generator but with diffrent commands

 Main: 
    - Command line arguments
    Need to print the how to use the command line
